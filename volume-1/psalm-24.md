# Psalm 24

Title. A Psalm of David.&nbsp;*From the title we learn nothing but the*&nbsp;

authorship: but this is interesting and leads us to observe the wondrous

operations of the Spirit upon the mind of Israel's sweet singer, enabling

him to touch the mournful string in Psalm twenty-two, to pour forth gentle

notes of peace in Psalm twenty-three, and here to utter majestic and

triumphant strains. We can do or sing all things when the Lord

strengtheneth us.

&nbsp;*This sacred hymn was probably written to be sung when the ark of the*&nbsp;

covenant was taken up from the house of Obed-edom, to remain within curtains

upon the hill of Zion. The words are not unsuitable for the sacred dance of

joy in which David led the way upon that joyful occasion. The eye of the

psalmist looked, however, beyond the typical upgoing of the ark to the

sublime ascension of the King of glory. We will call itThe Song of the

Ascension.

Division.&nbsp;*The Psalm makes a pair with the fifteenth Psalm. It consists of*&nbsp;

three parts. The first glorifiesthe true God,&nbsp;*and sings of his universal*&nbsp;

dominion; the second describesthe true Israel,&nbsp;*who are able to commune*&nbsp;

with him; and the third pictures the ascent ofthe true Redeemer,&nbsp;*who has*&nbsp;

opened heaven's gates for the entrance of his elect.

## EXPOSITION

Verse 1. How very different is this from the ignorant Jewish notion of God

which prevailed in our Saviour's day? The Jews said, "The holy land is

God's, and the seed of Abraham are his only people;" but their great Monarch

had long before instructed them,—&nbsp;*"The earth is the Lord's, and the*&nbsp;

fulness thereof."The whole round world is claimed for Jehovah,&nbsp;*"and they*&nbsp;

that dwell therein"are declared to be his subjects. When we consider the

bigotry of the Jewish people at the time of Christ, and how angry they were

with our Lord for saying that many widows were in Israel, but unto none of

them was the prophet sent, save only to the widow of Sarepta, and that there

were many lepers in Israel, but none of them was healed except Naaman the

Syrian,—when we recollect, too, how angry they were at the mention of

Paul's being sent to the Gentiles, we are amazed that they should have

remained in such blindness, and yet have sung this psalm, which shows so

clearly that God is not the God of the Jews only, but of the Gentiles also.

What a rebuke is this to those wiseacres who speak of the negro and other

despised races as though they were not cared for by the God of heaven! If a

man be but a man the Lord claims him, and who dares to brand him as a mere

piece of merchandise! The meanest of men is a dweller in the world, and

therefore belongs to Jehovah. Jesus Christ had made an end of the

exclusiveness of nationalities. There is neither barbarian, Scythian, bond

not free; but we all are one in Christ Jesus.

Man lives upon&nbsp;*"the earth,"*&nbsp;and parcels out its soil among his mimic

kings and autocrats; but the earth is not man's. He is but a tenant at

will, a leaseholder upon the most precarious tenure, liable to instantaneous

ejectment. The great Landowner and true Proprietor holds his court above

the clouds, and laughs at the title-deeds of worms of the dust. The

fee-simple is not with the lord of the manor nor the freeholder, but with

the Creator. The&nbsp;*"fulness"*&nbsp;of the earth may mean its harvests, its

wealth, its life, or its worship; in all these senses the Most High God is

Possessor of all. The earth is full of God; he made it full and he keeps it

full, notwithstanding all the demands which living creatures make upon its

stores. The sea is full, despite all the clouds which rise from it; the air

is full, notwithstanding all the lives which breathe it; the soil is full,

though millions of plants derive their nourishment from it. Under man's

tutored hand the world is coming to a greater fulness than ever, but it is

all the Lord's; the field and the fruit, the earth and all earth's wonders

are Jehovah's. We look also for a sublimer fulness when the true ideal of a

world for God shall have been reached in millennial glories, and then most

clearly the earth will be be the Lord's and the fulness thereof. These

words are now upon London's Royal Exchange, they shall one day be written in

letters of light across the sky.

The term&nbsp;*"world"*&nbsp;indicates the habitable regions, wherein Jehovah is

especially to be acknowledged as Sovereign. He who rules the fish of the

sea and the fowl of the air should not be disobeyed by man, his noblest

creature. Jehovah is the Universal King, all nations are beneath his sway:

true Autocrat of all the nations, emperors and czars are but his slaves.

Men are not their own, nor may they call their lips, their hearts, or their

substance their own; they are Jehovah's rightful servants. This claim

especially applies to us who are born from heaven. We do not belong to the

world or to Satan, but by creation and redemption we are the peculiar

portion of the Lord.

Paul uses this verse twice, to show that no food is unclean, and that

nothing is really the property of false gods. All things are God's; no ban

is on the face of nature, nothing is common or unclean. The world is all

God's world, and the food which is sold in the shambles is sanctified by

being my Father's, and I need not scruple to eat thereof.

Verse 2. In the second verse we have the reason why the world belongs to

God, namely, because he has created it, which is a title beyond all dispute.

&nbsp;*"For he hath founded it upon the seas."*&nbsp;It is God who lifts up the earth

from out of the sea, so that the dry land, which otherwise might in a moment

be submerged, as in the days of Noah, is kept from the floods. The hungry

jaws of ocean would devour the dry land if a constant fiat of Omnipotence

did not protect it.&nbsp;*"He hath established it upon the floods."*&nbsp;The world

is Jehovah's, because from generation to generation he preserves and upholds

it, having settled its foundations. Providence and Creation are the two

legal seals upon the title-deeds of the great Owner of all things. He who

built the house and bears up its foundations has surely a first claim upon

it. Let it be noted, however, upon what insecure foundations all

terrestrial things are founded. Founded on the seas! Established on the

floods! Blessed be God the Christian has another world to look forward to,

and rests his hopes upon a more stable foundation than this poor world

affords. They who trust in worldly things build upon the sea; but we have

laid our hopes, by God's grace, upon the Rock of Ages; we are resting upon

the promise of an immutable God, we are depending upon the constancy of a

faithful Redeemer. Oh! ye worldlings, who have built your castles of

confidence, your palaces of wealth, and your bowers of pleasure upon the

seas, and established them upon the floods; how soon will your baseless

fabrics melt, like foam upon the waters! Sand is treacherous enough, but

what shall be said of the yet more unstable sea?

Verses 3-6. Here we have the true Israel described. The men who shall

stand as courtiers in the palace of the living God are not distinguished by

race, but by character; they are not Jews only, nor Gentiles only, nor any

one branch of mankind peculiarly, but a people purified and made meet to

dwell in the holy hill of the Lord.

Verse 3.&nbsp;*"Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord?"*&nbsp;It is uphill work

for the creature to reach the Creator. Where is the mighty climber who can

scale the towering heights? Nor is it height alone; it is glory too. Whose

eye shall see the King in his beauty and dwell in his palace? In heaven he

reigns most gloriously, who shall be permitted to enter into his royal

presence? God has made all, but he will not save all; there is a chosen

company who shall have the singular honour of dwelling with him in his high

abode. These choice spirits desire to commune with God, and their wish

shall be granted them. The solemn enquiry of the text is repeated in

another form. Who shall be able to&nbsp;*"stand"*&nbsp;or continue there? He casteth

away the wicked, who then can abide in his house? Who is he that can gaze

upon the Holy One, and can abide in the blaze of his glory? Certainly none

may venture to commune with God upon the footing of the law, but grace can

make us meet to behold the vision of the divine presence. The question

before us is one which all should ask for themselves, and none should be at

ease till they have received an answer of peace. With careful

self-examination let us enquire, "Lord, is it I."

Verse 4.&nbsp;*"He that hath clean hands."*&nbsp;Outward, practical holiness is a

very precious mark of grace. To wash in water with Pilate is nothing, but

to wash in innocency is all-important. It is to be feared that many

professors have perverted the doctrine of justification by faith in such a

way as to treat good works with contempt; if so, they will receive

everlasting contempt at the last great day. It is vain to prate of inward

experience unless the daily life is free from impurity, dishonesty,

violence, and oppression. Those who draw near to God must have&nbsp;*"clean*&nbsp;

hands."What monarch would have servants with filthy hands to wait at his

table? They who were ceremonially unclean could not enter into the Lord's

house which was made with hands, much less shall the morally defiled be

allowed to enjoy spiritual fellowship with a holy God. If our hands are now

unclean, let us wash them in Jesu's precious blood, and so let us pray unto

God, lifting up pure hands. But&nbsp;*"clean hands"*&nbsp;would not suffice, unless

they were connected with&nbsp;*"a pure heart."*&nbsp;True religion is heart-work. We

may wash the outside of the cup and the platter as long as we please; but if

the inward parts be filthy, we are filthy altogether in the sight of God,

for our hearts are more truly ourselves than our hands are. We may lose our

hands and yet live, but we could not lose our heart and still live; the very

life of our being lies in the inner nature, and hence the imperative need of

purity within. There must be a work of grace in the core of the heart as

well as in the palm of the hand, or our religion is a delusion. May God

grant that our inward powers may be cleansed by the sanctifying Spirit, so

that we may love holiness and abhor all sin. The pure in heart shall see

God, all others are but blind bats; stone-blindness in the eyes arises from

stone in the heart. Dirt in the heart throws dust in the eyes.

The soul must be delivered from delighting in the grovelling toys of

earth; the man who is born for heaven&nbsp;*"hath not lifted up his soul unto*&nbsp;

vanity."All men have their joys, by which their souls are lifted up; the

worldling lifts up his soul in carnal delights, which are mere empty

vanities; but the saint loves more substantial things; like Jehoshaphat, he

is lifted up in the ways of the Lord. He who is content with the husks will

be reckoned with the swine. If we suck our consolation from the breasts of

the world, we prove ourselves to be its home-born children. Does the world

satisfy thee? Then thou hast thy reward and thy portion in this life; make

much of it, for thou shalt know no other joy.

&nbsp;*"Nor sworn deceitfully."*&nbsp;The saints are men of honour still. The

Christian man's word is his only oath; but that is as good as twenty oaths

of other men. False speaking will shut any man out of heaven, for a liar

shall not enter into God's house, whatever may be his professions or doings.

God will have nothing to do with liars, except to cast them into the lake of

fire. Every liar is a child of the devil, and will be sent home to his

father. A false declaration, a fraudulent statement, a cooked account, a

slander, a lie—all these may suit the assembly of the ungodly, but are

detested among true saints: how could they have fellowship with the God of

truth, if they did not hate every false way?

Verse 5. It must not be supposed that the persons who are thus described by

their inward and outward holiness are saved by the merits of their works;

but their works are the evidences by which they are known. The present

verse shows that in the saints grace reigns and grace alone. Such men wear

the holy livery of the Great King because he has of his own free love

clothed them therewith. The true saint wears the wedding garment, but he

owns that the Lord of the feast provided it for him, without money and

without price.&nbsp;*"He shall receive the blessing from the Lord, and*&nbsp;

righteousness from the God of his salvation."So that the saints need

salvation; they receive righteousness, and&nbsp;*"the blessing"*&nbsp;is a boon from

God their Saviour. They do not ascend the hill of the Lord as givers but as

receivers, and they do not wear their own merits, but a righteousness which

they have received. Holy living ensures a blessing as its reward from the

thrice Holy God, but it is itself a blessing of the New Covenant and a

delightful fruit of the Spirit. God first gives us good works, and then

rewards us for them. Grace is not obscured by God's demand for holiness,

but is highly exalted as we see it decking the saint with jewels, and

clothing him in fair white linen; all this sumptuous array being a free gift

of mercy.

Verse 6.&nbsp;*"This is the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy*&nbsp;

face, O Jacob."These are the regeneration, these are in the line of

grace; these are the legitimate seed. Yet they are only seekers; hence

learn that true seekers are very dear in God's esteem, and are entered upon

his register. Even&nbsp;*seeking*&nbsp;has a sanctifying influence; what a

consecrating power must lie in finding and enjoying the Lord's face and

favour! To desire communion with God is a purifying thing. Oh to hunger

and thirst more and more after a clear vision of the face of God; this will

lead us to purge ourselves from all filthiness, and to walk with heavenly

circumspection. He who longs to see his friend when he passes takes care to

clear the mist from the window, lest by any means his friend should go by

unobserved. Really awakened souls seek the Lord above everything, and as

this is not the usual desire of mankind, they constitute a generation by

themselves; a people despised of men but beloved of God. The expression&nbsp;*"O*&nbsp;

Jacob"is a very difficult one, unless it be indeed true that the God of

Jacob here condescendeth to be called Jacob, and takes upon himself the name

of his chosen people.

The preceding verses correct the inordinate boastings of those Jews who

vaunted themselves as the favourites of heaven; they are told that their God

is the God of all the earth, and that he is holy, and will admit none but

holy ones into his presence. Let the mere professor as he reads these

verses listen to the voice which saith, "without holiness no man shall see

the Lord."

&nbsp;*"Selah."*&nbsp;Lift up the harp and voice, for a nobler song is coming; a

song of our Well-beloved.

Verse 7. These last verses reveal to us the great representative man, who

answered to the full character laid down, and therefore by his own right

ascended the holy hill of Zion. Our Lord Jesus Christ could ascend into the

hill of the Lord because his hands were clean and his heart was pure, and if

we by faith in him are conformed to his image we shall enter too. We have

here a picture of our Lord's glorious ascent. We see him rising from amidst

the little group upon Olivet, and as the cloud receives him, angels

reverently escort him to the gates of heaven.

The ancient gates of the eternal temple are personified and addressed

in song by the attending cohorts of rejoicing spirits.

## "Lo his triumphal chariot waits,

And angels chant the solemn lay.

'Lift up your heads, ye heavenly gates;

Ye everlasting doors, give way."

They are called upon&nbsp;*"to lift up their heads,"*&nbsp;as though with all

their glory they were not great enough for the Allglorious King. Let all

things do their utmost to honour so great a Prince; let the highest heaven

put on unusual loftiness in honour of&nbsp;*"the King of Glory."*&nbsp;He who, fresh

from the cross and the tomb, now rides through the gates of the New

Jerusalem is higher than the heavens; great and everlasting as they are,

those gates of pearl are all unworthy of him before whom the heavens are not

pure, and who chargeth his angels with folly.&nbsp;*"Lift up your heads, O ye*&nbsp;

gates."

Verse 8. The watchers at the gate hearing the song look over the

battlements and ask,&nbsp;*"Who is this King of glory?"*&nbsp;A question full of

meaning and worthy of the meditations of eternity. Who is he in person,

nature, character, office and work? What is his pedigree? What his rank

and what his race? The answer given in a mighty wave of music is,&nbsp;*"The*&nbsp;

Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle."We know the might of

Jesus by the battles which he has fought, the victories which he has won

over sin, and death, and hell, and we clap our hands as we see him leading

captivity captive in the majesty of his strength. Oh for a heart to sing

his praises! Mighty hero, be thou crowned for ever King of kings and Lord

of lords.

Verse 9.&nbsp;*"Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift them up, ye*&nbsp;

everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in."The words are

repeated with a pleasing variation. There are times of deep earnest feeling

when repetitions are not vain but full of force. Doors were often taken

from their hinges when Easterns would show welcome to a guest, and some

doors were drawn up and down like a portcullis, and may possibly have

protruded from the top; thus literally lifting up their heads. The picture

is highly poetical, and shows how wide heaven's gate is set by the ascension

of our Lord. Blessed be God, the gates have never been shut since. The

opened gates of heaven invite the weakest believer to enter.

Dear reader, it is possible that you are saying, "I shall never enter

into the heaven of God, for I have neither clean hands nor a pure heart."

Look then to Christ, who has already climbed the holy hill. He has entered

as the forerunner of those who trust him. Follow in his footsteps, and

repose upon his merit. He rides triumphantly into heaven, and you shall

ride there too if you trust him. "But how can I get the character

described?" say you. The Spirit of God will give you that. He will create

in you a new heart and a right spirit. Faith in Jesus is the work of the

Holy Spirit, and has all virtues wrapped up in it. Faith stands by the

fountain filled with blood, and as she washes therein, clean hands and a

pure heart, a holy soul and a truthful tongue are given to her.

Verse 10. The closing note is inexpressibly grand. Jehovah of hosts, Lord

of men and angels, Lord of the universe, Lord of the worlds, is the King of

glory. All true glory is concentrated upon the true God, for all other

glory is but a passing pageant, the painted pomp of an hour. The ascended

Saviour is here declared to be the Head and Crown of the universe, the King

of Glory. Our Immanuel is hymned in sublimest strains. Jesus of Nazareth

is Jehovah Sabaoth.

## EXPLANATORY NOTES AND QUAINT SAYINGS

&nbsp;*Whole Psalm.*&nbsp;It will be seen that this Psalm was written to be chanted in

responsive parts, with two choruses. To comprehend it fully, it should be

understood that Jerusalem, as the city of God, was by the Jews regarded as a

type of heaven. It so occurs in the Apocalypse, whence we have adopted it

in our poetical and devotional aspirations. The court of the tabernacle was

the scene of the Lord's more immediate residence—the tabernacle his

palace, and the ark his throne. With this leading idea in his mind, the

most cursory reader—if there be cursory readers of the Bible—cannot

fail to be struck with the beauty and sublimity of this composition, and its

exquisite suitableness to the occasion. The chief musician, who was

probably in this case the king himself, appears to have begun the sacred lay

with a solemn and sonorous recital of these sentences:—

## "The earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof;

The world, and they that dwell therein.

For he hath founded it upon the seas,

And established it upon the floods."

The chorus of vocal music appears to have then taken up the song, and

sung the same words in a more tuneful and elaborate harmony; and the

instruments and the whole chorus of the people fell in with them, raising

the mighty declaration to heaven. There is much reason to think that the

people, or a large body of them, were qualified or instructed to take their

part in this great ceremonial. The historical text says, "David, and&nbsp;*all*&nbsp;

the house of Israel played before the Lord,upon all manner of

instruments," etc. We may presume that the chorus then divided, each

singing in their turns, and both joining at the close—

## "For he hath founded it upon the seas,

And established it upon the floods."

This part of the music may be supposed to have lasted until the procession

reached the foot of Zion, or came in view of it, which from the nature of

the enclosed site, cannot be till one comes quite near to it. Then the king

must be supposed to have stepped forth, and begun again, in a solemn and

earnest tone—

## "Who shall ascend into the holy hill of the Lord?

Or who shall stand in his holy place?"

To which the first chorus responds—

## "He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart;

Who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully."

And then the second chorus—

## "He shall receive the blessing from the Lord,

And righteousness from the God of his salvation."

This part of the sacred song may, in like manner, be supposed to have lasted till they reached the gate of the city, when the king began again in this grand and exalted strain:—

## "Lift up your heads, O ye gates;

And be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors,

And the King of glory shall come in."

repeated then, in the same way as before, by the general chorus.

The persons having charge of the gates on this high occasion ask—

## "Who is the King of glory?"

To which the first chorus answers—

## "It is Jehovah, strong and mighty—

Jehovah mighty in battle."

which the second chorus then repeats in like manner as before, closing it

with the grand universal chorus,

## "He is the King of glory! He is the King of glory!"

We must now suppose the instruments to take up the same notes, and continue them to the entrance to the court of the tabernacle. There the

king again begins—

## "Lift up your heads, O ye gates;

And be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors;

And the King of glory shall come in."

This is followed and answered as before—all closing, the instruments

sounding, the chorus singing, the people shouting—

## "He is the King of glory."

&nbsp;*John Kitto's "Daily Bible Illustrations."*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Whole Psalm.*&nbsp;The coming of the Lord of glory, the high demands upon his

people proceeding from this, the absolute necessity to prepare worthily for

his arrival, form the subject-matter of this Psalm.

&nbsp;*Whole Psalm.*&nbsp;We learn from the rabbins, that this was one of certain

Psalms which were sung in the performance of Jewish worship on each day in

the week:—

** The 24th Psalm on the 1st, the Lord's-day, our Sunday.**&nbsp;

48th   "          2nd            "

82nd   "          3rd            "

94th   "          4th            "

81st   "          5th            "

93rd   "          6th            "

92nd   "          7th, the Jewish Sabbath.

This Psalm, then, appropriated to the Lord's-day, our Sunday, was

intended to celebrate the resurrection of Messiah, and his ascension into

heaven, there to sit as priest upon God's throne, and from thence to come

down bringing blessings and mercies to his people.

&nbsp;*Patrick Delany, D.D.,*&nbsp;1686-1768.

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;1.&nbsp;*"The earth is the Lord's,"*&nbsp;that is, Christ's, who is the "Lord

of lords" (Revelation 19:16); for the whole world and all the things therein

are his by a twofold title. First, by donation of God his Father, having

"all power given unto him in heaven and in earth" (Matthew 28:18), even

whatsoever things the Father hath are his (John 16:15); and so consequently

"made heir of all things." Hebrews 1:2. Secondly, the earth is Christ's

and all that therein is, by right of creation, for&nbsp;*"he founded it,"*&nbsp;saith

our prophet, and that after a wonderful manner,&nbsp;*"upon the seas and*&nbsp;

floods.". . . All things then are Christ's, in respect of

&nbsp;*creation*&nbsp;, by whom all things were made" (John 1:3); in respect of

&nbsp;*sustentation,*&nbsp;as upholding all things by his mighty word (Hebrews 1:3); in

respect of&nbsp;*administration,*&nbsp;as reaching from one end to another, and

ordering all things sweetly (Wisdom 8:1): in one word—"Of him, and

through him, and to him, are all things." Romans 11:36. From hence we may

learn (1), That Christ is "the King of glory," "Lord of Hosts," even

Almighty God. For he that made all, is "Lord over all;" he that is the

Creator of heaven and earth is Almighty (saith our Creed); able to do

whatsoever he will, and more than he will too—more by his absolute

power, than he will by his actual—"able to raise up children unto

Abraham" out of the very stones of the street, though he doth not actually

produce such a generation. His almightiness evidently proves him to be God,

and his&nbsp;*founding of the world*&nbsp;his almightiness; for "The gods that have

not made the heaven and earth shall perish from the earth, and from under

these heavens." Jeremiah 10:11. (2.) Seeing the compass of the world and

all they that dwell therein are the Lord's, it is plain that the church is

not confined within the limits of one region, or glued, as it were, to one

seat only. The Donatists in old time, would tie the church only to

Cartenna in Africa, the Papists in our time to Rome in Italy; but the

Scriptures plainly affirm that the golden candlesticks are removed from one

place to another, and that the kingdom of God is taken away from one nation

and given unto another country that brings forth the fruit thereof; in every

region he that feareth God and worketh righteousness is accepted of him.

Acts 10:35.

&nbsp;*John Boys.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;1.&nbsp;*"The earth is Jehovah's."*&nbsp;The object of the beginning of the

Psalm is to show that the Jews had nothing of themselves which could entitle

them to approach nearer or more familiarly to God than the Gentiles. As God

by his providence preserves the world, the power of his government is alike

extended to all, so that he ought to be worshipped by all, even as he also

shows to all men, without exception, the fatherly care he has about them.

&nbsp;*J. Calvin.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;1.&nbsp;*"The earth is the Lord's."*&nbsp;It is Christ's, by creation (verse

2; John 1:1, 2), and it is his by resurrection (Matthew 28:18), and by his

glorious ascension into heaven, where he is enthroned King of the world in

his human nature. This Psalm takes up the language of the first Ascension

Psalm (Psalm 8.)

&nbsp;*Christopher Wordsworth, D.D., in loc.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;1. St. Chrysostom, suffering under the Empress Eudoxia, tells his

friend Cyriacus how he armed himself before hand:&nbsp;*ei me ' bouletai n*&nbsp;

basilissa e xorisai me,etc. "I thought, will she banish me?&nbsp;*'The earth*&nbsp;

is the Lord's and the fulness thereof.'Take away my goods?&nbsp;*'Naked came*&nbsp;

I into the world, and naked must I return.'Will she stone me? I

remembered Stephen. Behead me? John Baptist came into my mind," etc. Thus

it should be with every one that intends to live and die comfortably: they

must, as we say, lay up something for a rainy day; they must stock

themselves with graces, store up promises, and furnish themselves with

experiences of God's lovingkindness to others and themselves too, that so

when the evil day comes, they may have much good coming thereby.

&nbsp;*John Spencer.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;1.&nbsp;*"The earth is the Lord's."*&nbsp;As David, in his youthful days,

was tending his flocks on Bethlehem's fertile plains, the spirit of the Lord

descended upon him, and his senses were opened, and his understanding

enlightened, so that he could understand the songs of the night. The

heavens proclaimed the glory of God, and glittering stars formed the general

chorus, their harmonious melody resounded upon earth, and the sweet fulness

of their voices vibrated to it utmost bounds.

&nbsp;*Light*&nbsp;is the countenance of the Eternal," sung the setting sun: "I am

the hem of his garment," responded the soft and rosy twilight. The clouds

gathered themselves together and said, "We are his nocturnal tent." And the

waters in the clouds, and the hollow voices of the thunders, joined in the

lofty chorus, "The voice of the Eternal is upon the waters, the God of glory

thundereth in the heavens, the Lord is upon many waters."

"He flieth upon my wings," whispered the winds, and the gentle air

added, "I am the breath of God, the aspirations of his benign presence."

"We hear the songs of praise," said the parched earth; "all around is

praise; I alone am sad and silent." Then the falling dew replied, "I will

nourish thee, so that thou shalt be refreshed and rejoice, and thy infants

shall bloom like the young rose." "Joyfully we bloom," sang the refreshed

meads; the full ears of corn waved as they sang, "We are the blessing of

God, the hosts of God against famine."

"We bless thee from above," said the gentle moon; "We, too, bless thee,"

responded the stars; and the lightsome grasshopper chirped, "Me, too, he

blesses in the pearly dew-drop." "He quenched my thirst," said the roe;

"And refreshed me," continued the stag; "And grants us our food," said the

beasts of the forest; "And clothes my lambs," gratefully added the sheep.

"He heard me," croaked the raven, "when I was forsaken and alone;" "He

heard me," said the wild goat of the rocks, "when my time came, and I

brought forth." And the turtle-dove cooed, and the swallow and other birds

joined the song, "We have found our nests, our houses, we dwell upon the

altar of the Lord, and sleep under the shadow of his wing in tranquillity

and peace." "And peace," replied the night, and echo prolonged the sound,

when chanticleer awoke the dawn, and crowed with joy, "Open the portals, set

wide the gates of the world! The King of glory approaches. Awake! Arise,

ye sons of men, give praises and thanks unto the Lord, for the King of glory

approaches."

The sun arose, and David awoke from his melodious rapture. But as long

as he lived the strains of creation's harmony remained in his soul, and

daily he recalled them from the strings of his harp.

&nbsp;*From the "Legend of the Songs of the Night," in the Talmud, quoted in*&nbsp;

"Biblical Antiquities." By F. A. Cox, D.D., LL.D.,1852.

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;1. The pious mind views all things in God,, and God in all things.

&nbsp;*Ingram Cobbin,*&nbsp;1839.

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;2.&nbsp;*"He hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the*&nbsp;

floods."This&nbsp;*founding the land upon the seas,*&nbsp;and preparing it&nbsp;*upon*&nbsp;

the floods,is so wonderfully wonderful, that Almighty God asked his

servant Job, "Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened?" Job 38:6.

Xerxes commanded his soldiers to fetter the waters of Hellispontus; and so

God bindeth, as it were, the floods in fetters, at St. Basil plainly,

&nbsp;*Ligatum est mare præcepto Creatoris quasi compedibus;*&nbsp;he saith unto the

sea, "Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further, there shall it stay thy

proud waves." "He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap; he

layeth up the depth in storehouses" (Job 38:11; Psalm 33:7); so that without

his leave not so much as one drop can overflow the land.

&nbsp;*John Boys.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;2. (New translation.)&nbsp;*"For he hath founded it upon the seas, and*&nbsp;

upon streams doth he make it fast."The reference is no doubt to the

account of the Creation, in Genesis, the dry land having emerged from the

water, and seeming to rest upon it. (Comp. 136:6; Proverbs 8:29.) It

would, however, be quite out of place to suppose that in such language we

have the expression of any theory, whether popular or scientific, as to the

structure of the earth's surface: Job says (26:7), "He hangeth the earth

upon nothing." Such expressions are manifestly poetical. See Job 38:6.

&nbsp;*J. J. Stewart Perowne.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;2.&nbsp;*"Upon the seas:"*&nbsp;that is, upon the great abyss of water which

is under the earth, enclosed in great hollow places, whence the heads of

rivers do spring, and other waters bubble out upon the earth.

&nbsp;*John Diodati.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;2.&nbsp;*"Above the floods he hath established it."*&nbsp;Both the words

(Heb.) (Al) in the two clauses of this verse mean either "above" as we have

rendered it, and refer to Genesis 1:9, 10, denoting that Jehovah hath called

forth dry land from the midst of the seas, and established it above the

floods, and hath set a boundary to the latter never to turn and overflow it

(see Job 38:8; Psalm 104. chronologically Psalm 7:9); or "by, or at," as

they often denote, and refer to the same subject of the omnipotence of God

in relation to the same quoted passages,&nbsp;*i.e.,*&nbsp;that though our globe is

situated at or by the floods—is surrounded with mighty waters whose

single wave could bury it for ever, still the Lord has so established it

that this never can happen. This is a mighty reason why the earth and all

its fulness and inhabitants belong to Jehovah.

&nbsp;*Benjamin Weiss.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;2. Hereby is mystically meant, that he hath set his church above

the waters of adversities, so that how high soever they arise, it is kept

still above them in safety, and so shall be for evermore; or it may agree

thus—he will take in all nations to be in his grace, because all be his

creatures; he made them so admirable an habitation at the first, and upholds

it still, showing hereby how much he regards them; therefore he will now

extend his favour further towards them, by taking them in to be his people.

&nbsp;*Augustine, quoted by Mayer.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;3.&nbsp;*"Who shall ascend?"*&nbsp;Indeed, if none must ascend but he that

is clean and pure, and without vanity and deceit, the question is quickly

answered, None shall, for there is none&nbsp;*so:*&nbsp;dust is our matter, so not

clean; defiled is our nature, so not pure; lighter, the heaviest of us, than

vanity, and deceitful upon the balance the best of us; so no ascending so

high for any of us. Yet there is One we hear of, or might have heard of

to-day, that rose and ascended up on high, was thus qualified as the

psalmist speaks of, all clean and pure, no chaff at all, no guile found in

his mouth. 1 Peter 2:22. Yes, but it was but One that was so; what's that

to all the rest? Yes, somewhat 'tis.&nbsp;*He*&nbsp;was our&nbsp;*Head,*&nbsp;and if the Head

be once risen and ascended, the members will all follow after in their time.

&nbsp;*Mark Frank.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;3.&nbsp;*"The hill of the Lord,"*&nbsp;can be no other than a hill of glory.

His holy place is no less than the very place and seat of glory. And being

such, you cannot imagine it but&nbsp;*hard to come by,*&nbsp;the very petty glories of

the world are so. This is a&nbsp;*hill*&nbsp;of glory, hard to climb, difficult to

ascend, craggy to pass up, steep to clamber, no plain campagnia to it, the

broad easy way leads some whither else (Matthew 7:13); the way to this is

narrow (verse 14); 'tis rough and troublesome. To be of the number of

Christ's true faithful servants is no slight work; 'tis a fight, 'tis a

race, 'tis a continual warfare; fastings and watchings, and cold and

nakedness, and hunger and thirst, bonds, imprisonments, dangers and

distresses, ignominy and reproach, afflictions and persecutions, the world's

hatred and our friend's neglect, all that we call hard or difficult is to be

found in the way we are to go. A man cannot leave a lust, shake off bad

company, quit a course of sin, enter upon a way of virtue, profess his

religion, or stand to it, cannot ascend the spiritual&nbsp;*hill,*&nbsp;but he will

meet some or other of these to contest and strive with. But not only to

ascend, but to&nbsp;*stand*&nbsp;there, as the word signifies; to continue at so high

a pitch, to be constant in truth and piety, that will be hard indeed, and

bring more difficulties to contest with.

&nbsp;*Mark Frank.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verses*&nbsp;3, 4. The Psalm begins with a solicitous enquiry, subjoins a

satisfactory answer, and closes with a most pertinent but rapturous

apostrophe. This is the enquiry,&nbsp;*"Who shall ascend into the hill of the*&nbsp;

Lord? or who shall stand in his holy place?"This is the answer,&nbsp;*"He that*&nbsp;

hath clean hands, and a pure heart;" "he shall receive the blessing"of

plenary remission&nbsp;*"from the Lord, and righteousness also from the God of*&nbsp;

his salvation:"even that perfect righteousness which is not acquired by

man, but bestowed by Jehovah; which is not performed by the saint, but

received by the sinner; which is the only solid basis to support our hopes

of happiness, the only valid plea for an admission into the mansions of joy.

Then follows the apostrophe: the prophet foresees the ascension of Christ

and his saints into the kingdom of heaven. He sees his Lord marching at the

head of the redeemed world, and conducting them into regions of honour and

joy. Suitably to such a view, and in a most beautiful strain of poetry, he

addresses himself to the heavenly portals.&nbsp;*"Lift up your heads, O ye*&nbsp;

gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory,"

with all the heirs of his grace and righteousness, shall make their

triumphant entry;&nbsp;*"shall enter in,"*&nbsp;and go out no more.

&nbsp;*James Hervey.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verses*&nbsp;3, 4. It is not he who sings so well or so many Psalms, nor he who

fasts or watches so many days, nor he who divides his own among the poor,

nor he who preaches to others, nor he who lives quietly, kindly, and

friendly; nor, in fine, is it he who knows all sciences and languages, nor

he who works all virtuous and all good works that ever any man spoke or read

of, but it is he alone, who is pure within and without.

&nbsp;*Martin Luther.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;4.&nbsp;*"He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart."*&nbsp;Shall I tell

you, then, who is a moral man in the sight of God? It is he that bows to

the divine law as the supreme rule of right; he that is influenced by a

governing regard to God in all his actions; he that obeys other commands

spontaneously, because he has obeyed the first and great command, "Give me

thy&nbsp;*heart."*&nbsp;His conduct is not conformed to custom or expediency, but to

one consistent, immutable standard of duty. Take this man into a court of

justice, and call on him to testify, and he will not bear false witness.

Give him the charge of untold treasures, he will not steal. Trust him with

the dearest interests of yourself or family, you are safe, because he has a

living principle of truth and integrity in his bosom. He is as worthy of

confidence in the dark as at noonday; for he is a moral man, not because

reputation or interest demands it, not because the eye of public observation

is fixed upon him, but because the love and fear of God have predominant

ascendency in his heart.

&nbsp;*Ebenezer Porter, D.D.,*&nbsp;1834.

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;4. Conditions that suit none but Christ. (Bellarmine.)&nbsp;*"He that*&nbsp;

hath clean hands;""the clean of hands," Margin:—those hands from which

went forth virtue and healing; hands ever lifted up in prayer to God, or in

blessing to man; hands stretched forth on the cross for the cleansing of the

whole world.

&nbsp;*Isaac Williams, in loc.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;4.&nbsp;*"Who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity,"*&nbsp;is read by

Arius Montanus, "He that hath not received his soul in vain." Oh! how many

receive their souls in vain, making no more use of them than the swine, of

whom the philosopher observes,&nbsp;*cujus anima pro sale,*&nbsp;their souls are only

for salt to keep their bodies from stinking. Who would not grieve to think

that so choice a piece should be employed about so vain a use!

&nbsp;*George Swinnock.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;4.&nbsp;*"Nor sworn deceitfully;"*&nbsp;or inured his tongue to any other

kind of language of hell's rotten communication, to the dishonouring of God,

or deceiving of others. Perjury is here instanced for the rest, as one of

the most heinous. But Peraldus reckoneth up four-and-twenty several sins of

the tongue, all which every burgess of the New Jerusalem is careful to

avoid, as the devil's drivel, no way becoming his pure lip.

&nbsp;*John Trapp.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;4. Now we come to the four conditions requisite to render such an

ascent possible. 1. Abstinence from evil doing:&nbsp;*"He that hath clean*&nbsp;

hands."2. Abstinence from evil thought:&nbsp;*"and a pure heart."*&nbsp;3. Who

does that duty which he is sent into the world to do:&nbsp;*"That hath not lifted*&nbsp;

up his mind unto vanity;"or, as it is in the Vulgate,&nbsp;*"Who hath no*&nbsp;

received his soul in vain."And, 4. Remembers the vows by which he is

bound to God:&nbsp;*"nor sworn to deceive."*&nbsp;And in the fullest sense, there was

but One in whom all these things were fulfilled; so that in reply to the

question, "Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord?" He might well

answer, "No man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from

heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven." John 3:13. "Therefore it

is well-written," says St. Bernard, "that such an High Priest became us,

because he knows the difficulty of that ascent to the celestial mountain, he

knows the weakness of us that have to ascend."

&nbsp;*Lorinus and Bernard, quoted by J. M. Neale.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;4. Heaven is not won with good words and a fair profession. The

doing Christian is the man that shall stand, when the empty boaster of his

faith shall fall. The great talkers of religion are often the least doers.

His religion is in vain whose profession brings not letters testimonial from

a holy life.

&nbsp;*William Gurnall.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;5.&nbsp;*"He shall receive the blessing;"*&nbsp;as before, "Thou shalt set

him to be a blessing." Psalm 21:6. His name is never without blessing. In

him shall all the nations of the earth be blessed. On the mount of his

beatitudes, on the heavenly Mount Sion, crowned as "the Son of the Blessed."

&nbsp;*"From the Lord;"*&nbsp;even "the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ."

Ephesians 1:3.

&nbsp;*Isaac Williams.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;5.&nbsp;*"He shall receive . . . righteousness."*&nbsp;As for our own

righteousness which we have without him, Esay telleth us, "it is a defiled

cloth;" and St. Paul, that it is but "dung." Two very homely comparisons,

but they be the Holy Ghost's own; yet nothing so homely as in the original,

where they be so odious, as what manner of defiled cloth, or what kind of

dung, we have not dared to translate. Our own then being no better, we are

driven to seek for it elsewhere.&nbsp;*"He shall receive his righteousness,"*&nbsp;

saith the prophet; and&nbsp;*"the gift of righteousness,"*&nbsp;saith the apostle.

Philippians 3:8, 9; Romans 5:17. It is then another, to be&nbsp;*given us,*&nbsp;and

to be&nbsp;*received*&nbsp;by us, which we must seek for. And whither shall we go for

it? Job alone dispatcheth this point (chapter 15:15; 4:18; 25:5.) Not to

&nbsp;*the heavens*&nbsp;or&nbsp;*stars,*&nbsp;they are&nbsp;*unclean in his sight.*&nbsp;Not to the

&nbsp;*saints*&nbsp;, for in them&nbsp;*he found folly.*&nbsp;Not to the&nbsp;*angels,*&nbsp;for neither in

them found he&nbsp;*steadfastness.*&nbsp;Now, if none of these will serve, we see a

necessary reason why Jehovah must be a part of this name, "the LORD our

righteousness." Jeremiah 23:6.

&nbsp;*Lancelot Andrewes.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;6.&nbsp;*"This is the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy*&nbsp;

face."Christians must be seekers. This is&nbsp;*the generation of seekers.*&nbsp;

All mankind, if ever they will come to heaven, they must be a generation of

seekers. Heaven is a generation of finders, of possessors, of enjoyers,

seekers of God. But here we are a generation of seekers. We want somewhat

that we must seek. When we are at best, we want the accomplishment of our

happiness. It is a state of seeking here, because it is a state of want; we

want something alway. But to come more particularly to this&nbsp;*seeking the*&nbsp;

face of God, or the presence of God. . . . The presence of God meant here

is, that presence that he shows&nbsp;*in the time of need, and in his*&nbsp;

ordinances.He shows a presence in need and necessity, that is, a gracious

presence to his children, a gracious face. As in want of direction, he

shows his presence of light to direct them; in weakness he shows his

strength; in trouble and perplexity he will show his gracious and

comfortable presence to comfort them. In perplexity he shows his presence

to set the heart at large, answerable to the necessity. So in need God is

present with his children, to direct them, to comfort them, to strengthen

them, if they need that.

&nbsp;*Richard Sibbes.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;6.&nbsp;*"This is the generation."*&nbsp;By the demonstrative pronoun

&nbsp;*"this,"*&nbsp;the psalmist erases from the catalogue of the servants of God all

counterfeit Israelites, who, trusting only to their circumcision and the

sacrifice of beasts, have no concern about offering themselves to God; and

yet, at the same time, they rashly thrust themselves into the church.

&nbsp;*John Calvin.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;6.&nbsp;*"That seek thy face, O Jacob."*&nbsp;In Proverbs 7:15, and 29:26,

we have&nbsp;*"seeking the face of"*&nbsp;in the sense of seeking the favour of, or

showing delight in. Their delight is not in Esau, who got "the fatness of

earth" (Genesis 27:39) as his portion. And those writers may be right, who

consider Jacob as a name for Messiah, to whom belong the true birthright and

blessing.

&nbsp;*Andrew A. Bonar.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;6.&nbsp;*"That seek thy face, O Jacob."*&nbsp;He is "the seed of Jacob;" he

is "the Holy One of Israel;" "the face of thine Anointed" is the face of him

who is both God and man; for "we shall see him as he is."

&nbsp;*Isaac Williams.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;6.&nbsp;*"O Jacob,"*&nbsp;or O God of Jacob. As the church is called

&nbsp;*Christ*&nbsp;(1 Corinthians 12:12), so God is here called&nbsp;*"Jacob;"*&nbsp;such a near

union there is betwixt him and his people. Or,&nbsp;*this is*&nbsp;Jacob. So the

true&nbsp;*seekers*&nbsp;are fitly called, first because Israelites indeed (John 1:47;

Romans 9:6); secondly, because they see God face to face, as Jacob did at

Peniel (Genesis 32:24-30); thirdly, because they also, as he, do bear away

a blessing (Hosea 12:4), even "righteousness from the God of their

salvation," as in the verse aforegoing.

&nbsp;*John Trapp.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;7.&nbsp;*"Lift up your heads, O ye gates."*&nbsp;The gates of the temple

were indeed as described, very lofty and magnificent, in proportion to the

gigantic dimensions of that extraordinary edifice. But the phrase,&nbsp;*"Lift*&nbsp;

up your heads,"refers not so much to their loftiness, as to the upper part

being formed so as to be lifted up; while the under portion opened in

folding doors.

&nbsp;*Robert Jamieson, in "Paxton's Illustrations of Scriptures."*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;7.&nbsp;*"Lift up your heads, O ye gates."*&nbsp;At the castle of Banias, in

Syria, are the remains of an ancient gate which was drawn up, like a blind,

the gate fitting in grooves. This will fully explain the term.

&nbsp;*John Gadsby.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;7.&nbsp;*"Lift up."*&nbsp;A phrase or term taken from triumphal arches, or

great porticoes, set up, or beautified and adorned for the coming in of

great, victorious, and triumphant captains.

&nbsp;*John Diodati.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;7.&nbsp;*"Be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory*&nbsp;

shall come in."Some interpret this of the doors of our heart, according

to that (Revelation 3:20), "Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any

man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him," etc. In the

gospel history, we find that Christ had a fourfold entertainment among men.

Some received him into house, not into heart, as Simon the Pharisee (Luke

7:44), who gave him no kiss nor water to his feet; some into heart, but not

into house, as the faithful centurion (Matthew 8:8), esteeming himself

unworthy that Christ should come under his roof; some neither into house nor

heart, as the graceless Gergesites (Matthew 8:34); some both into house and

heart, as Lazarus, Mary, Martha. John 3:15; Luke 10:38. Now that Christ

may dwell in our hearts by faith, and that our bodies may be temples of his

Holy Spirit, we must as our prophet exhorts here,&nbsp;*lift up our souls,*&nbsp;that

is, in the words of St. Paul (Colossians 3:2), our affections must be set on

things which are above, and not on things which are on earth: if we desire

to lift up our hearts unto Christ's verity, we may not lift them up unto the

world's vanity; that is, we must not fasten our love too much upon the

things of this life, but on those pleasures at God's right hand which are

evermore; that as we have borne the image of the first Adam, who was

earthly, so we should bear the image of the second Adam, which is heavenly.

1 Corinthians 15:49. The prophane worldling sings a&nbsp;*Nunc dimittis*&nbsp;unto

Christ, and saith as the devils, "Ah! what have we to do with thee, thou

Jesus of Nazareth?" (Mark 1:24); and as Job reports his words, "Depart from

us, for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways." Job 21:14. On the

contrary, the religious soul, enjoying the possession of the Saviour,

chanteth a merry&nbsp;*Magnificat,*&nbsp;and a pleasant&nbsp;*Te Deum:*&nbsp;she saith unto

Christ, as Ruth unto Naomi (Ruth 1:16), "Intreat me not to leave thee, or to

return from following after thee." Nay, death itself shall not part us, for

when I am loosed out of my body's prison, I hope to be with Christ; as Ittai

then unto David, I say unto Jesus, "As the Lord liveth, and as my lord the

king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether in

death, or life, even there also will thy servant be." 2 Samuel 15:21. O

Lord, which art the God of my salvation, I lift my heart to thee, desirous

to seek thee, both in the right&nbsp;*ubi*&nbsp;—where thou mayest be found, and in

the right&nbsp;*quando*&nbsp;—while thou mayest be found. Psalm 18:47; 25:1. Open

my dull ears and hard heart, that thy Son my Saviour may come in and dwell

with me. Grant me grace that I may still hear while he calleth, open while

he knocketh, and hold him also when I have him; that I may both&nbsp;*ascend*&nbsp;

thine hill,and&nbsp;*stand in thy holy place;*&nbsp;that I may not only sojourn in

thy tabernacle, but also rest and dwell upon the mountain of thine holiness.

&nbsp;*John Boys.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;7.&nbsp;*"Everlasting doors."*&nbsp;Heaven's gates are called

&nbsp;*"everlasting,"*&nbsp;because they shall endure for ever, or because they be the

doors unto the life which is everlasting.

&nbsp;*John Boys.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;7. Whatever we may think of these things, David thought it high

time for him to bid such a messenger welcome, and to open his heart for the

receiving of his God. Hear what he saith to his own heart and others:

&nbsp;*"Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors;*&nbsp;

and the King of glory shall come in."And because the door of men's hearts

is locked, and barred, and bolted, and men are in a deep sleep, and will not

hear the knocking that is at the gate, though it be loud, though it be a

king; therefore David knocks again,&nbsp;*"Lift up, ye everlasting doors."*&nbsp;Why,

what haste, saith the sinner? What haste? Why, here's the King at your

gates; and that not an ordinary king neither; he is a glorious King, that

will honour you so far, if you open quickly, as to lodge within, to take up

his abode in your house, to dwell with you. But the soul for all this doth

not yet open, but stands still questioning, as if it were an enemy rather

than a friend that stood there, and asks,&nbsp;*"Who is this King of glory?"*&nbsp;

Who? He answers again,&nbsp;*"It is the Lord of Hosts;"*&nbsp;he, that if you will

not open quickly and thankfully too, can easily pull your house down about

your ears; he is the Lord of hosts, that King who hath a mighty army always

at his command, who stand ready to their commission, and then you should

know who it is you might have had for your friend; "Lift up, therefore, your

heads, O ye gates." Open quickly, ye that had rather have God for your

friend, than for your enemy. Oh, why should not the soul of every sinner

cry out, Lord, the door is locked, and thou hast the key; I have been trying

what I can do, but the wards are so rusty that I cannot possibly turn the

key? But, Lord, throw the door off the hinges, anything in the world, so

thou wilt but come in and dwell here. Come, O mighty God, break through

doors of iron, and bars of brass, and make way for thyself by thy love and

power. Come, Lord, and make thyself welcome; all that I have is at thy

service; O fit my soul to entertain thee!

&nbsp;*James Janeway.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;7. He hath left with us the earnest if the Spirit, and taken from

us the earnest of our flesh, which he hath carried into heaven as a pledge

that the whole shall follow after.

&nbsp;*Tertullian.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;7. Christ is gone to heaven as a victor; leading sin, Satan, death,

hell, and all his enemies, in triumph at his chariot wheels. He has not

only overcome his enemies for himself, but for all his people, whom he will

make conquerors, yea, "more than conquerors." As he has overcome, so shall

they also overcome; and as he has gone to heaven a victor, they shall follow

in triumph. He is in heaven as a Saviour. When he came from heaven it was

in the character of a Saviour; when on earth he obtained eternal salvation;

in heaven he lives as a Saviour; when he comes again from heaven he will

come as a Saviour; and when he will return, he will return as a Saviour. He

is also gone to heaven as the rightful heir. He is not gone to heaven as a

sojourner, but as "the heir of all things." He is the heir of heavenly

glory and happiness, and believers are "heirs of God, and joint heirs with

Christ."

&nbsp;*Henry Pendlebury,*&nbsp;1626-1695.

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;7. O clap your hands together, all ye people; sing unto God with

the voice of melody. God is gone up with a merry noise, and the Lord with

the sound of the trump." Psalm 47: 1, 5. This Ark, which has saved the

world from destruction, after floating on a deluge of blood, rests at length

on the mountain. This innocent Joseph, whose virtue has been oppressed by

the synagogue, is brought out of the dungeon to receive a crown. This

invincible Samson has carried away the gates of hell, and goes in triumph to

the everlasting hills. This victorious Joshua has passed over Jordan with

the ark of the covenant, and taken possession of the land of the living.

This Sun of righteousness, which had gone down ten degrees, returns

backward to the place which it had left. He who was "a worm" at his birth,

a Lamb in his passion, and a Lion in his resurrection, now ascends as an

Eagle to heaven, and encourages us to follow him thither. This day heaven

learns to endure man's presence, and men to walk above the stars; the

heavenly Jerusalem receives its rightful King, the church its High Priest,

the house of God its Heritor, the whole world its Ruler. "O sing praises,

sing praises unto our God: O sing praises, sing praises unto our King."

Psalm 47:6-8. "God reigneth over the heathen, God sitteth upon his holy

seat." "The princes of the people are joined unto" him; "he is very highly

exalted" above them.

&nbsp;*From "The Life of Jesus Christ in Glory," translated from the French of*&nbsp;

James Nouet.

&nbsp;*Verses*&nbsp;7, 8. Christ being now arrived at heaven's doors, those heavenly

spirits that accompanied him began to say,&nbsp;*"Lift up your heads, O ye gates;*&nbsp;

and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come

in!"to whom some of the angels that were within, not ignorant of his

person, but admiring his majesty and glory, said again,&nbsp;*"Who is the King of*&nbsp;

glory?"and then they answered&nbsp;*"The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord*&nbsp;

mighty in battle,"and thereupon those twelve gates of the holy city, of

New Jerusalem, opened of their own accord, and Jesus Christ with all his

ministering spirits entered in. O my soul, how should this heighten thy joy

and enlarge thy comforts, in that Christ is now received up into glory?

Every sight of Christ is glorious, and in every sight thou shouldst wait on

the Lord Jesus Christ for some glorious manifestations of himself. Come,

live up to the rate of this great mystery; view Christ as entering into

glory, and thou wilt find the same sparkle of glory on thy heart. O! this

sight is a transforming sight: "We all, with open face beholding as in a

glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to

glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord." 2 Corinthians 3:18.

&nbsp;*Isaac Ambrose.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verses*&nbsp;7, 8. Ye that are thus the living temples of the Lord, and have

already entertained his sanctifying Spirit into you, do you lift up your

hearts in the use of holy ordinances through faith, in joyful desires and

assured expectation of him; yea, be you abundantly lift up by faith in the

use of holy means who are the everlasting habitation of an everlasting God,

with a joyful and assured welcome of him; for so shall you invite and

undoubtedly entertain the high and mighty Potentate the Lord Christ into

your souls, with the glorious manifestation and ravishing operation of his

love, benefits, and graces. And know, O all ye faithful and obedient ones,

for your courage and comfort, who, and of what quality this glorious King,

the Lord Jesus is, whom the world despises but you honour. Why, he is the

Almighty God, of power all-sufficient to preserve and defend his people and

church, that in trust of him do love and serve him, against all the strength

and power of men and devils that do or shall malign or oppose themselves

against them, and to put them to the foil, as we his Israel in the letter

have found by experience for your instruction and corroboration that are his

people in spirit.

&nbsp;*George Abbot, in "Brief notes upon the whole Book of Psalms,"*&nbsp;1651.

&nbsp;*Verses*&nbsp;7-10. Oh, what tongue of the highest archangel of heaven can

express the welcome of thee, the King of glory, into these blessed regions

of immortality? Surely the empyreal heaven never resounded with so much

joy: God ascended with jubilation and the Lord with the sound of the

trumpet. It is not for us, weak and finite creatures, to wish to conceive

those incomprehensible, spiritual, divine gratulations, that the glorious

Trinity gave to the victorious and now glorified human nature. Certainly

if, when he brought his only-begotten Son into the world, he said, "Let all

the angels worship him;" much more now that he, "ascendeth on high, and hath

led captivity captive, hath he given him a name above all names, that at the

name of Jesus all knees should bow." And if the holy angels did so carol at

his birth, in the very entrance into that state of humiliation and

infirmity, with what triumph did they receive him now returning from the

perfect achievement of man's redemption? and if, when his type had

vanquished Goliath, and carried his head into Jerusalem, the damsels came

forth to meet him with dances and timbrels, how shall we think those angelic

spirits triumphed, in meeting of the great Conqueror of hell and death? How

did they sing,&nbsp;*"Lift up your heads, ye gates! and be lifted up, ye*&nbsp;

everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in."Surely, as he

shall come, so he went; and, "Behold, he shall come with thousands of his

holy ones; thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand

thousands stood before him;" from all whom, methinks I hear that blessed

applause, "Worthy is the Lamb that was killed, to receive power, and riches,

and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and praise: praise and

honour, and glory, and power, be to him that sitteth upon the throne, and to

the Lamb for evermore." And why dost not thou, O my soul, help to bear thy

part with that happy choir of heaven? Why art not thou rapt out of my

bosom, with an ecstasy of joy, to see this human nature of ours exalted

above all the powers of heaven, adored of angels, archangels, cherubim,

seraphim, and all those mighty and glorious spirits, and sitting there

crowned with infinite glory and majesty?

&nbsp;*Joseph Hall.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verses*&nbsp;7-10. In the twenty-fourth Psalm, we have an account of the

actual entrance of Christ into heaven. When the King of England wishes to

enter the city of London through Temple Bar, the gate being closed against

him, the herald demands entrance. "Open the gate." From within a voice is

heard, "Who is there?" The herald answers, "The King of England!" The gate

is at once opened, and the king passes, amidst the joyful acclamations of

his people. This is an ancient custom, and the allusion is to it in this

Psalm. "The Lord ascended with a shout;" he approached the heavenly portal

—the herald in his escort demanded an entrance,&nbsp;*"Lift up your heads, O*&nbsp;

ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory

shall come in."The celestial watchers within ask,&nbsp;*"Who is the King of*&nbsp;

glory?"The heralds answer,&nbsp;*"The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty*&nbsp;

in battle."The question and answer being repeated once more, the gates

lift up their heads, and the everlasting doors are lifted up. The Prince

enters his Father's palace, greeted with the acclamations of heaven, all

whose inhabitants unite in one shout of joy ineffable:&nbsp;*"The Lord of Hosts,*&nbsp;

he is the King of glory!"

&nbsp;*Christmas Evans.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verses*&nbsp;7-10. If we follow our Redeemer in his ascension and session at

the right hand of God, where he is constituted Lord of all, angels,

principalities, and powers being made subject to him, and where he sits till

his enemies are made his footstool, we shall observe the tide of celestial

blessedness rise higher and higher still. The return of a great and beloved

prince, who should by only hazarding his life, have saved his country, would

fill a nation with ecstasy. Their conversation in every company would turn

upon him, and all their thoughts and joys concentrate in him. See then the

King of kings, after having by death abolished death, and brought life and

immortality to light; after spoiling the powers of darkness, and ruining all

their schemes; see him return in triumph! There was something like triumph

when he entered into Jerusalem. All the city was moved, saying, "Who is

this?" And the multitude answered, It is Jesus, the prophet of Nazareth;

and the very children sung, Hosannah to the Son of David: blessed be he that

cometh in the name of the Lord; hosannah in the highest! How much greater

then must be the triumph of his entry into the heavenly Jerusalem! Would

not all the city be "moved" in this case, saying,&nbsp;*"Who is this?"*&nbsp;See

thousands of angels attending him, and ten thousand times ten thousand come

forth to meet him! The entrance of the ark into the city of David was but a

shadow of this, and the responsive strains which were sung on that occasion

would on this be much more applicable.

&nbsp;*Andrew Fuller.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verses*&nbsp;7-10. Why is the song repeated? Why are the everlasting gates

invited to lift up their heads a second time? We may not pretend here, or

in any place, to know all the meaning of the divine Psalms. But what if the

repetition of the verse was meant to put us in mind that our Saviour's

ascension will be repeated also? He will not indeed die any more; death can

no more have any dominion over him; "there remaineth no more sacrifice for

sin." Neither of course can he rise again any more. But as he will come

again at the end of the world, to judge the quick and the dead, so after

that descent he will have to ascend again. And I say, this second ascension

may be signified by the psalmist, calling on the everlasting doors to lift

up their heads a second time, and make way for the King of glory. Now

observe the answer made this second time,&nbsp;*"Who is the King of glory? The*&nbsp;

Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle. Lift up your heads, O ye

gates; even lift them up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall

come in. Who is this King of glory? The Lord of hosts, he is the King of

glory."Before it was,&nbsp;*"the Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in*&nbsp;

battle;"now it is&nbsp;*"The Lord of hosts."*&nbsp;Christ ascending the first time,

to intercede for us at his Father's right hand, is called&nbsp;*"The Lord mighty*&nbsp;

in battle."But Christ, ascending the second time, after the world hath

been judged, and the good and bad separated for ever, is called&nbsp;*"the Lord*&nbsp;

of hosts."Why this difference in his divine titles? We may reverently

take it, that it signifies to us the difference between his first and second

coming down to earth, his first and second ascension into heaven. As in

other respects his first coming was with great humility, so in this, that he

came, in all appearance, alone. The angels were indeed waiting round him,

but not visibly, not in glory. "He trode the winepress alone, and of the

people there was none with him." He wrestled with death, hell, and Satan,

alone. Alone he rose from the dead: alone, as far as man could see, he went

up to heaven. Thus he showed himself "the Lord mighty in battle," mighty in

that single combat which he, as our champion, our David, victoriously

maintained against our great enemy. But when he shall come down and go up

the second time, he will show himself "the Lord of hosts." Instead of coming

down alone in mysterious silence, as in his wonderful incarnation, he will

be followed by all the armies of heaven. "The Lord my God will come, and

all his saints with him." "The Lord cometh with ten thousand of his

saints." "The Son of Man will come in the glory of his Father, and all the

holy angels with him." "Thousand thousands will stand around him, and ten

thousand times ten thousand will minister unto him." Instead of the silence

of that quiet chamber at Nazareth, and of the holy Virgin's womb, there will

be the voice of the archangel, and the trump of God accompanying him. Thus

he will come down as the Lord of hosts, and as the Lord of hosts, he will

ascend again to his Father. After the judgment, he will pass again through

the everlasting doors, with a greater company than before; for he will lead

along with him, into the heavenly habitation, all those who shall have been

raised from their graves and found worthy. Hear how the awful sight is

described by one who will doubtless have a high place in that day near the

Judge. The great apostle and prophet St. Paul, says, "The Lord himself

shall descend from heaven with a shout; and the dead in Christ shall rise

first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with

them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air, and so shall we ever be

with the Lord."

&nbsp;*John Keble, M.A.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verses*&nbsp;7-10.—

## In this blessed life

I see the path, and in his death the price,

And in his great ascent the proof supreme

Of immortality. And did he rise?

Hear, O ye nations! hear it, O ye dead!

He rose! He rose! He burst the bars of death.

Lift up your heads, ye everlasting gates!

And give the King of glory to come in.

Who is the King of glory? He who left

His throne of glory for the pangs of death.

Lift up your heads, ye everlasting gates!

And give the King of glory to come in.

Who is the King of glory? He who slew

The ravenous foe that gorged all human race.

The King of glory, he whose glory filled

Heaven with amazement at his love to man,

And with divine complacency beheld

Powers most illumined 'wildered in the theme.

&nbsp;*Edward Young.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verses*&nbsp;7-10.—

## Lift up your heads, ye gates, and, O prepare,

Ye living orbs, your everlasting doors,

The King of glory comes!

What King of glory? He whose puissant might

Subdued Abaddon, and the infernal powers

Of darkness bound in adamantine chains:

Who, wrapp'd in glory, with the Father reigns,

Omnipotent, immortal, infinite!

&nbsp;*James Scott.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;8.&nbsp;*"Who is the King of glory?"*&nbsp;Christ in two respects is&nbsp;*"the*&nbsp;

King of glory."1. For that all honour and glory belongs properly to him

—his is "the kingdom, the power, and the glory" (Matthew 6:13), called in

this regard, "The Lord of glory." 1 Corinthians 2:8. 2. For that Christ

maketh us partakers of his glory, termed in this respect our glorious Lord

Jesus. James 2:1. If the Lord of hosts, strong and mighty in battle, be

the King of glory, then Christ (having conquered all his enemies, and made

them his footstool, triumphing over death, and the devil which is the

founder of death, and sin which is the sting of death, and the grave which

is the prison of death, and hell itself which is the proper dominion of the

devil and death) is doubtless in himself,&nbsp;*"the King of glory."*&nbsp;And for as

much as he died for our sins, and is risen again for our justification, and

is ascended on high to give gifts unto men—in this life grace, in the

next glory—what is he less than a&nbsp;*"King of glory"*&nbsp;towards us, of whom

and through whom alone we find that fight his battles are delivered from the

hands of all that hate us, and so made victors (1 Corinthians 15:57), yea,

"more than conquerors." Romans 8:37.

&nbsp;*John Boys.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;8.&nbsp;*"The Lord strong and mighty." "Strong and mighty"*&nbsp;in

subduing all adversaries; and overcoming death and the devil who had the

power of death.

&nbsp;*Ludolphus, quoted by Isaac Williams.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;10.&nbsp;*"Jehovah of hosts,"*&nbsp;or, as the Hebrew is,&nbsp;*Jehovah Tsebaoth,*&nbsp;

for so the word is used by the apostles, untranslated in the Greek,

&nbsp;*Sabaoth.*&nbsp;Romans 9:29. It signifieth&nbsp;*hosts*&nbsp;or&nbsp;*armies*&nbsp;standing ready

in martial order, and in battle array, and comprehendeth all creatures in

heaven and in earth, which are pressed to do the will of God.
