# Psalm 1

TITLE.&nbsp;*This Psalm may be regarded as*&nbsp;THE PREFACE PSALM,&nbsp;*having in it a*&nbsp;

notification of the contents of the entire Book.  It is the psalmists's

desire to teach us the way to blessedness, and to warn us of the sure

destruction of sinners.  This, then, is the matter of the first Psalm, which

may be looked upon, in some respects, as the text upon which the whole of

the Psalms make up a divine sermon.

DIVISION.&nbsp;*This Psalm consists of two parts: in the first (from verse 1 to*&nbsp;

the end of the 3rd) David sets out wherein the felicity and blessedness of a

godly man consisteth, what his exercises are, and what blessings he shall

receive from the Lord.  In the second part (from verse 4 to the end) he

contrasts the state and character of the ungodly, reveals the future, and

describes, in telling language, his ultimate doom.

## EXPOSITION

Verse 1.&nbsp;*"BLESSED"*&nbsp;—see how this Book of Psalms opens with a

benediction, even as did the famous Sermon of our Lord upon the Mount!  The

word translated "blessed" is a very expressive one.  The original word is

plural, and it is a controverted matter whether it is an adjective or a

substantive.  Hence we may learn the multiplicity of the blessings which

shall rest upon the man whom God hath justified, and the perfection and

greatness of the blessedness he shall enjoy.  We might read it, "Oh, the

blessednesses!" and we may well regard it (as Ainsworth does) as a joyful

acclamation of the gracious man's felicity.  May the like benediction rest

on us!

Here the gracious man is described both negatively

(verse 1) and

positively (verse 2).  He is a man&nbsp;*who does not walk in the counsel of the*&nbsp;

ungodly.He takes wiser counsel, and walks in the commandments of the Lord

his God.  To him the ways of piety are paths of peace and pleasantness.  His

footsteps are ordered by the Word of God, and not by the cunning and wicked

devices of carnal men.  It is a rich sign of inward grace when the outward

walk is changed, and when ungodliness is put far from our actions.  Note

next,&nbsp;*he standeth not in the way of sinners.*&nbsp;His company is of a choicer

sort than it was.  Although a sinner himself, he is now a blood-washed

sinner, quickened by the Holy Spirit, and renewed in heart.  Standing by the

rich grace of God in the congregation of the righteous, he dares not herd

with the multitude that do evil.  Again it is said,&nbsp;*"nor sitteth in the*&nbsp;

seat of the scornful."He finds no rest in the atheist's scoffings.  Let

others make a mock of sin, of eternity, of hell and heaven, and of the

Eternal God; this man has learned better philosophy than that of the

infidel, and has too much sense of God's presence to endure to hear His name

blasphemed.  The seat of the scorner may be very lofty, but it is very near

to the gate of hell; let us flee from it, for it shall soon be empty, and

destruction shall swallow up the man who sits therein.  Mark the gradation

in the first verse:

He walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly,

Nor&nbsp;*standeth*&nbsp;in the&nbsp;*way*&nbsp;of     sinners,

Nor SITTETH    in the SEAT    of     SCORNFUL.

When men are living in sin they go from bad to worse.

At first they

merely&nbsp;*walk*&nbsp;in the counsel of the careless and&nbsp;*ungodly,*&nbsp;who forget God—the evil is rather practical than habitual—but after that, they become

habituated to evil, and they&nbsp;*stand*&nbsp;in the way of open&nbsp;*sinners*&nbsp;who

wilfully violate God's commandments; and if let alone, they go one step

further, and become themselves pestilent teachers and tempters of others,

and thus they&nbsp;*sit in the seat of the scornful.*&nbsp;They have taken their

degree in vice, and as true Doctors of Damnation they are installed, and are

looked up to by others as Masters in Belial.  But the blessed man, the man

to whom all the blessings of God belong, can hold no communion with such

characters as these.  He keeps himself pure from these lepers; he puts away

evil things from him as garments spotted by the flesh; he comes out from

among the wicked, and goes without the camp, bearing the reproach of Christ.

O for grace to be thus separate from sinners.

And now mark his positive character.&nbsp;*"His delight is*&nbsp;

in the law

of the Lord."He is not&nbsp;*under*&nbsp;the law as a curse and condemnation, but he

is&nbsp;*in*&nbsp;it, and he delights to be in it as his rule of life; he delights,

moreover, to&nbsp;*meditate*&nbsp;in it, to read it&nbsp;*by day,*&nbsp;and think upon it&nbsp;*by*&nbsp;

night.He takes a text and carries it with him all day long; and in the

night-watches, when sleep forsakes his eyelids, he museth upon the Word of

God.  In the&nbsp;*day*&nbsp;of his prosperity he sings&nbsp;*psalms*&nbsp;out of the Word of

God, and in the&nbsp;*night*&nbsp;of his affliction he comforts himself with

&nbsp;*promises*&nbsp;out of the same book.  "The law of the Lord" is the daily bread

of the true believer.  And yet, in David's day, how small was the volume of

inspiration, for they had scarcely anything save the first five books of

Moses!  How much more, then, should we prize the whole written Word which it

is our privilege to have in all our houses!  But, alas, what ill-treatment

is given to this angel from heaven!  We are not all Berean searchers of the

Scriptures.  How few among us can lay claim to the benediction of the text!

Perhaps some of you can claim a sort of negative purity, because you do not

walk in the way of the ungodly; but let me ask you—Is your delight in

the law of God?  Do you study God's Word?  Do you make it the man of your

right hand—your best companion and hourly guide?  If not, this blessing

belongeth not to you.

Verse 3.  "&nbsp;*And he shall be like a tree planted*&nbsp;"—not a wild tree, but

"a tree&nbsp;*planted,"*&nbsp;chosen, considered as property, cultivated and secured

from the last terrible uprooting, for "every plant which my heavenly Father

hath not planted, shall be rooted up:" Matthew 15:13.&nbsp;*"By the rivers of*&nbsp;

water;"so that even if one river should fail, he hath another.  The rivers

of pardon and the rivers of grace, the rivers of the promise and the rivers

of communion with Christ, are never-failing sources of supply.  He is "like

a tree planted by the rivers of water,&nbsp;*that bringeth forth his fruit in his*&nbsp;

season;"not unseasonable graces, like untimely figs, which are never

full-flavored.  But the man who delights in God's Word, being taught by it,

bringeth forth patience in the time of suffering, faith in the day of trial,

and holy joy in the hour of prosperity.  Fruitfulness is an essential

quality of a gracious man, and that fruitfulness should be seasonable.

&nbsp;*"His leaf also shall not wither;"*&nbsp;his faintest word shall be everlasting;

his little deeds of love shall be had in remembrance.  Not simply shall his

fruit be preserved, but&nbsp;*his leaf*&nbsp;also.  He shall neither lose his beauty

nor his fruitfulness.&nbsp;*"And whatsoever he doeth shall prosper."*&nbsp;Blessed

is the man who hath such a promise as this.  But we must not always estimate

the fulfillment of a promise by our own eye-sight.  How often, my brethren,

if we judge by feeble sense, may we come to the mournful conclusion of

Jacob, "All these things are against me!"  For though we know our interest

in the promise, yet we are so tried and troubled, that sight sees the very

reverse of what that promise foretells.  But to the eye of faith this word

is sure, and by it we perceive that our works are prospered, even when

everything seems to go against us.  It is not outward prosperity which the

Christian most desires and values; it is soul prosperity which he longs for.

We often, like Jehoshaphat, make ships to go to Tarshish for gold, but they

are broken at Ezion-geber; but even here there is a true prospering, for it

is often for the soul's health that we would be poor, bereaved, and

persecuted.  Our worst things are often our best things.  As there is a

curse wrapped up in the wicked man's mercies, so there is a blessing

concealed in the righteous man's crosses, losses, and sorrows.  The trials

of the saint are a divine husbandry, by which he grows and brings forth

abundant fruit.

Verse 4.  We have now come to the second head of the Psalm.  In this verse

the contrast of the ill estate of the wicked is employed to heighten the

coloring of that fair and pleasant picture which precedes it.  The more

forcible translation of the Vulgate and of the Septuagint version is—

&nbsp;*"Not so the ungodly, not so."*&nbsp;And we are hereby to understand that

whatever good thing is said of the righteous is not true in the case of the

ungodly.  Oh!  how terrible is it to have a double negative put upon the

promises! and yet this is just the condition of the ungodly.  Mark the use

of the term&nbsp;*"ungodly,"*&nbsp;for, as we have seen in the opening of the Psalm,

these are the beginners in evil, and are the least offensive of sinners.

Oh! if such is the sad state of those who quietly continue in their

morality, and neglect their God, what must be the condition of open sinners

and shameless infidels?  The first sentence is a negative description of the

ungodly, and the second is the positive picture.  Here is their&nbsp;*character*&nbsp;

—&nbsp;*"they are like chaff,"*&nbsp;intrinsically worthless, dead, unserviceable,

without substance, and easily carried away.  Here, also, mark their&nbsp;*doom,*&nbsp;

—&nbsp;*"the wind driveth away;"*&nbsp;death shall hurry them with its terrible

blast into the fire in which they shall be utterly consumed.

Verse 5.  They shall stand there to be judged, but not to be acquitted.

Fear shall lay hold upon them there; they shall not stand their ground; they

shall flee away; they shall not stand in their own defence; for they shall

blush and be covered with eternal contempt.

Well may the saints long for heaven, for no evil men

shall dwell there,

&nbsp;*"nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous."*&nbsp;All our congregations

upon earth are mixed.  Every Church hath one devil in it.  The tares grow in

the same furrows as the wheat.  There is no floor which is as yet thoroughly

purged from chaff.  Sinners mix with saints, as dross mingles with gold.

God's precious diamonds still lie in the same field with pebbles.  Righteous

Lots are this side heaven continually vexed by the men of Sodom.  Let us

rejoice then, that in "the general assembly and church of the firstborn"

above, there shall by no means be admitted a single unrenewed soul.  Sinners

cannot live in heaven.  They would be out of their element.  Sooner could a

fish live upon a tree than the wicked in Paradise.  Heaven would be an

intolerable hell to an impenitent man, even if he could be allowed to enter;

but such a privilege shall never be granted to the man who perseveres in his

iniquities.  May God grant that we may have a name and a place in his courts

above!

Verse 6.  Or, as the Hebrew hath it yet more fully, "The Lord is&nbsp;*knowing*&nbsp;

the way of the righteous."  He is constantly looking on their way, and

though it may be often in mist and darkness, yet the Lord knoweth it.  If it

be in the clouds and tempest of affliction, he understandeth it.  He

numbereth the hairs of our head; he will not suffer any evil to befall us.

"He knoweth the way that I take: when He hath tried me, I shall come forth

as gold." (Job 23:10.)&nbsp;*"But the way of the ungodly shall perish."*&nbsp;Not

only shall&nbsp;*they*&nbsp;perish themselves, but&nbsp;*their way*&nbsp;shall perish too.  The

righteous carves his name upon the rock, but the wicked writes his

remembrance in the sand.  The righteous man ploughs the furrows of earth,

and sows a harvest here, which shall never be fully reaped till he enters

the enjoyments of eternity; but as for the wicked, he ploughs the sea, and

though there may seem to be a shining trail behind his keel, yet the waves

shall pass over it, and the place that knew him shall know him no more for

ever.  The very "way" of the ungodly shall perish.  If it exist in

remembrance, it shall be in the remembrance of the bad; for the Lord will

cause the name of the wicked to rot, to become a stench in the nostrils of

the good, and to be only known to the wicked themselves by its putridity.

May the Lord cleanse our hearts and our ways, that we

may escape the

doom of the ungodly, and enjoy the blessedness of the righteous!

## EXPLANATORY NOTES AND QUAINT SAYINGS

&nbsp;*Whole Psalm.*&nbsp;As the book of the Canticles is called the Song of Songs by

a Hebraism, it being the most excellent, so this Psalm may not unfitly be

entitled, the Psalm of Psalms, for it contains in it the very pith and

quintessence of Christianity.  What Jerome saith on St. Paul's epistles, the

same may I say of this Psalm; it is short as to the composure, but full of

length and strength as to the matter.  This Psalm carries blessedness in the

frontpiece; it begins where we all hope to end: it may well be called a

Christian's Guide, for it discovers the quicksands where the wicked sink

down in perdition, and the firm ground on which the saints tread to glory.—&nbsp;*Thomas*&nbsp;

Watson's Saints Spiritual Delight,1660.

This whole Psalm offers itself to be drawn into these

two

opposite propositions: a godly man is blessed, a wicked man is miserable;

which seem to stand as two challenges, made by the prophet: one, that he

will maintain a godly man against all comers, to be the only Jason for

winning the golden fleece of blessedness; the other, that albeit the ungodly

make a show in the world of being happy, yet they of all men are most

miserable.—&nbsp;*Sir Richard Baker,*&nbsp;1640

I have been induced to embrace the opinion of some among

the

ancient interpreters (Augustine, Jerome, etc.), who conceive that the first

Psalm is intended to be descriptive of the character and reward of the JUST

ONE,&nbsp;*i.e.*&nbsp;the Lord Jesus.—&nbsp;*John Fry*&nbsp;, B.A., 1842

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;1.  The psalmist saith more to the point about true happiness in

this short Psalm than any one of the philosophers, or all of them put

together; they did but beat the bush, God hath here put the bird into our

hand.

&nbsp;*John Trapp,*&nbsp;1660

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;1.  Where the word&nbsp;*blessed*&nbsp;is hung out as a sign, we may be sure

that we shall find a godly man within.

&nbsp;*Sir Richard Baker.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;1.  The seat of the drunkard is the seat of the scornful.

&nbsp;*Matthew Henry,*&nbsp;1662-1714

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;1.&nbsp;*"Walketh*&nbsp;NOT....NOR&nbsp;*standeth*&nbsp;....NOR&nbsp;*sitteth,"*&nbsp;

etc.

Negative precepts are in some cases more absolute and peremptory than

affirmatives; for to say, "that hath walketh in the counsel of the godly,"

might not be sufficient; for, he might walk in the counsel of the godly, and

yet walk in the counsel of the ungodly too; not both indeed at once, but

both at several times; where now, this negative clears him at all times.

&nbsp;*Sir Richard Baker.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;1.  The word (Heb)&nbsp;*haish*&nbsp;is emphatic,&nbsp;*that man;*&nbsp;that one

among a

&nbsp;*thousand*&nbsp;who lives for the accomplishment of the end for which God created

him.

&nbsp;*Adam Clarke,*&nbsp;1844

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;1.&nbsp;*"That walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly."*&nbsp;Mark

certain circumstances of their differing characters and conduct. I. The&nbsp;*ungodly*&nbsp;

manhas his&nbsp;*counsel.*&nbsp;II. The&nbsp;*sinner*&nbsp;has his&nbsp;*way;*&nbsp;and III.

The&nbsp;*scorner*&nbsp;has his&nbsp;*seat.*&nbsp;The&nbsp;*ungodly man*&nbsp;is unconcerned about

religion; he is neither zealous for his own salvation nor for that of others; and he

&nbsp;*counsels*&nbsp;and&nbsp;*advises*&nbsp;those with whom he converses to adopt his plan,

and not trouble

themselves about praying, reading, repentance, etc., etc.; "there is no need

for such things; live an honest life, make no fuss about religion, and you

will fare well enough at last." Now "blessed is the man who walks not in

this man's counsel," who does not come into his measures, nor act according

to his plan.

The&nbsp;*sinner*&nbsp;has his particular&nbsp;*way*&nbsp;of

transgressing; one is a

&nbsp;*drunkard,*&nbsp;another&nbsp;*dishonest,*&nbsp;another&nbsp;*unclean.*&nbsp;Few are given to

every

species of vice.  There are many&nbsp;*covetous*&nbsp;men who abhor&nbsp;*drunkenness,*&nbsp;

many&nbsp;*drunkards*&nbsp;who abhor&nbsp;*covetousness;*&nbsp;and so of others.&nbsp;*Each has*&nbsp;

his

easily besetting sin;therefore, says the prophet,&nbsp;*"Let the wicked*&nbsp;

forsake HIS WAY."  (Isaiah 55:7)  Now,&nbsp;*blessed is he who stands not is such*&nbsp;

a man'sWAY.

The&nbsp;*scorner*&nbsp;has brought, in reference to himself,

all religion and

moral feeling to an end.  He has&nbsp;*sat down*&nbsp;—is utterly confirmed in

impiety, and makes a mock at sin.  His conscience is seared, and he is a

believer in all unbelief.  Now,&nbsp;*blessed is the man who sits not down in*&nbsp;

hisSEAT.

&nbsp;*Adam Clarke.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;1.  In the Hebrew, the word&nbsp;*"blessed"*&nbsp;is a plural noun,&nbsp;*ashrey*&nbsp;

(blessednesses),that is, all blessednesses are the portion of that man who

has not gone away, etc.; as though it were said, "All things are well with

that man who," etc.  Why do you hold any dispute?  Why draw vain

conclusions?  If a man has found that pearl of great price, to love the law

of God and to be separate from the ungodly, all blessednesses belong to that

man; but, if he does not find this jewel, he will seek for all blessednesses

but will never find one!  For as all things are pure unto the pure, so all

things are lovely unto the loving, all things good unto the good; and,

universally, such as thou art thyself, such is God himself unto thee, though

he is not a creature.  He is perverse unto the perverse, and holy unto the

holy.  Hence nothing can be good or saving unto him who is evil: nothing

sweet unto him unto whom the law of God is not sweet.  The word&nbsp;*"counsel"*&nbsp;

is without doubt here to be received as signifying decrees and doctrines,

seeing that no society of men exists without being formed and preserved by

decrees and laws.  David, however, by this term strikes at the pride and

reprobate temerity of the ungodly.  First, because they will not humble

themselves so far as to walk in the law of the Lord, but rule themselves by

their own counsel.  And then he calls it their "counsel," because it is

their prudence, and the way that seems to them to be without error.  For

this is the destruction of the ungodly—their being prudent in their own

eyes and in their own esteem, and clothing their errors in the garb of

prudence and of the right way.  For if they came to men in the open garb of

error, it would not be so distinguishing a mark of blessedness not to walk

with them.  But David does not here say, "in the folly of the ungodly," or

"in the error of the ungodly;" and therefore he admonishes us to guard with

all diligence against the appearance of what is right, that the devil

transformed into an angel of light do not seduce us by his craftiness.  And

he contrasts the counsel of the wicked with the law of the Lord, that we may

learn to beware of wolves in sheep's clothing, who are always ready to give

counsel to all, to teach all, and to offer assistance unto all, when they

are of all men least qualified to do so.  The term&nbsp;*"stood"*&nbsp;descriptively

represents their obstinacy, and stiff-neckedness, wherein they harden

themselves and make their excuses in words of malice, having become

incorrigible in their ungodliness.  For "to stand," in the figurative manner

of Scripture expression, signifies to be firm and fixed: as in Romans 14:4,

"To his own master he standeth or falleth: yea, he shall be holden up, for

God is able to make him stand."  Hence the word "column" is by the Hebrew

derived from their verb "to stand," as is the word statue among the Latins.

For this is the very self-excuse and self-hardening of the ungodly—their

appearing to themselves to live rightly, and to shine in the eternal show of

works above all others.  With respect to the term&nbsp;*"seat,"*&nbsp;to sit in the

seat, is to teach, to act the instructor and teacher; as in Matthew 23:2,

"The scribes sit in Moses' chair."&nbsp;*They*&nbsp;sit in the seat of pestilence,

who fill the church with the opinions of philosophers, with the traditions

of men, and with the counsels of their own brain, and oppress miserable

consciences, setting aside, all the while, the word of God, by which alone

the soul is fed, lives, and is preserved.

&nbsp;*Martin Luther,*&nbsp;1536-1546.

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;1.&nbsp;*"The scornful."*&nbsp;&nbsp;*Peccator cum in profundum venerit*&nbsp;

contemnet—when a wicked man comes to the depth and worst of sin, he despiseth.

Then

the Hebrew will despise Moses (Exodus 2:14), "Who made thee a prince and a

judge over us?" Then Ahab will quarrel with Micaiah (1 Kings 22:18), because

he doth not prophecy good unto him.  Every child in Bethel will mock Elisha

(2 Kings 2:23), and be bold to call him "bald pate."  Here is an original

drop of venom swollen to a main ocean of poison: as one drop of some

serpents' poison, lighting on the hand, gets into the veins, and so spreads

itself over all the body till it hath stifled the vital spirits.  God shall

"laugh you to scorn," (Psalm 2:4), for laughing Him to scorn; and at last

despise you that have despised him in us.  That which a man spits against

heaven, shall fall back on his own face.  Your indignities done to your

spiritual physicians shall sleep in the dust with your ashes, but stand up

against your souls in judgment.

&nbsp;*Thomas Adams,*&nbsp;1614.

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;2.&nbsp;*"But his will is in the law of the Lord."*&nbsp;The "will," which

is here signified, is that delight of heart, and that certain pleasure, in

the law, which does not look at what the law promises, nor at what it

threatens, but at this only; that "the law is holy, and just, and good."

Hence it is not only a love of the law, but that loving delight in the law

which no prosperity, nor adversity, nor the world, nor the prince of it, can

either take away or destroy; for it victoriously bursts its way through

poverty, evil report, the cross, death, and hell, and in the midst of

adversities, shines the brightest.

&nbsp;*Martin Luther.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;2.&nbsp;*"His delight is in the law of the Lord."*&nbsp;—This&nbsp;*delight*&nbsp;

which the prophet here speaks of is the only delight that neither blushes

nor looks pale; the only delight that gives a repast without an after

reckoning; the only delight that stands in construction with all tenses; and

like AEneas Anchyses, carries his parents upon his back.

&nbsp;*Sir Richard Baker.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;2.&nbsp;*"In His law doth he meditate."*&nbsp;In the plainest text there is

a world of holiness and spirituality; and if we in prayer and dependence

upon God did sit down and study it, we should behold much more than appears

to us.  It may be, at once reading or looking, we see little or nothing; as

Elijah's servant went once, and saw nothing; therefore he was commanded to

look seven times.  What now? says the prophet, "I see a cloud rising, like a

man's hand;" and by-and-by, the whole surface of the heavens was covered

with clouds.  So you may look lightly upon a Scripture and see nothing;

&nbsp;*meditate often upon it*&nbsp;, and there you shall see a light, like the light of

the sun.

&nbsp;*Joseph Caryl,*&nbsp;1647.

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;2.&nbsp;*"In His law doth he meditate day and night."*&nbsp;—The good man

doth&nbsp;*meditate on the law of God day and night.*&nbsp;The pontificians beat off

the common people from this common treasury, by objecting this supposed

difficulty.  Oh, the Scriptures are hard to be understood, do not you

trouble your heads about them; we will tell you the meaning of them.  They

might as well say, heaven is a blessed place, but it is a hard way to it; do

not trouble yourselves, we will go thither for you.  Thus in the great day

of trial, when they should be saved by their book, alas! they have no book

to save them.  Instead of the Scriptures they can present images; these are

the layman's books; as if they were to be tried by a jury of carvers and

painters, and not by the twelve apostles.  Be not you so cheated; but study

the gospel as you look for comfort by the gospel.  He that hopes for the

inheritance, will make much of the conveyance.

&nbsp;*Thomas Adams.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;2.  To&nbsp;*"meditate,"*&nbsp;as it is generally understood, signifies to

discuss, to dispute; and its meaning is always confined to a being employed

in words, as in Psalm 32:30, "The mouth of the righteous shall meditate

wisdom."  Hence Augustine has, in his translation, "chatter;" and a

beautiful metaphor it is—as chattering is the employment of birds, so a

continual conversing in the law of the Lord (for talking is peculiar to

man), ought to be the employment of man.  But I cannot worthily and fully

set forth the gracious meaning and force of this word; for this "meditating"

consists first in an intent observing of the words of the law, and then in a

comparing of the different Scriptures; which is a certain delightful

hunting, nay, rather a playing with stags in a forest, where the Lord

furnishes us with the stags, and opens to us their secret coverts.  And from

this kind of employment, there comes forth at length a man well instructed

in the law of the Lord to speak unto the people.

&nbsp;*Martin Luther.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;2.&nbsp;*"In his law doth he meditate day and night."*&nbsp;The godly man

will read the Word by&nbsp;*day*&nbsp;, that men, seeing his good works, may glorify

his Father who is in heaven; he will do it in the&nbsp;*night*&nbsp;, that he may not

be seen of men: by&nbsp;*day*&nbsp;, to show that he is not one of those who dread the

light; by&nbsp;*night*&nbsp;, to show that he is one who can shine in the shade: by

&nbsp;*day*&nbsp;, for that is the time for working—work whilst it is day; by

&nbsp;*night*&nbsp;, lest his Master should come as a thief, and find him idle.

&nbsp;*Sir Richard Baker.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;2.  I have no rest, but in a nook, with&nbsp;*the book.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Thomas a Kempis,*&nbsp;1380-1471.

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;2.&nbsp;*"Meditate."*&nbsp;Meditation doth discriminate and characterise a

man; by this he may take a measure of his heart, whether it be good or bad;

let me allude to that; "For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he." Proverbs

23:7.  As the meditation is, such is the man.  Meditation is the touchstone

of a Christian; it shows what metal he is made of.  It is a spiritual index;

the index shows what is in the book, so meditation shows what is in the

heart.

&nbsp;*Thomas Watson's Saints' Spiritual Delight.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;2.  Meditation chews the cud, and gets the sweetness and nutritive

virtue of the Word into the heart and life: this is the way the godly bring

forth much fruit.

&nbsp;*Bartholomew Ashwood's Heavenly Trade,*&nbsp;1688.

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;2.  The naturalists observe that to uphold and accommodate bodily

life, there are diverse sorts of faculties communicated, and these among the

rest:

1\.An attractive faculty, to assume and draw in the

food;

2\.A retentive faculty, to retain it when taken in;

3\.As assimilating faculty to concoct the nourishment;

4\.An augmenting faculty, for drawing to perfection.

Meditation is all these.  It helps judgment, wisdom, and faith to ponder,

discern, and credit the things which reading and hearing supply and furnish.

It assists the memory to lock up the jewels of divine truth in her sure

treasury.  It has a digesting power, and turns special truth into spiritual

nourishment; and lastly, it helps the renewed heart to grow upward and

increase its power to know the things which are freely given to us of God.

&nbsp;*Condensed from Nathaniel Ranew,*&nbsp;1670.

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;3.&nbsp;*"A tree."*&nbsp;—There is one tree, only to be found in the

valley of the Jordan, but too beautiful to be entirely passed over; the

oleander, with its bright blossoms and dark green leaves, giving the aspect

of a rich garden to any spot where it grows.  It is rarely if ever alluded

to in the Scriptures.  But it may be the tree planted by the streams of

water which bringeth forth his fruit in due season, and "whose leaf shall

not wither."

&nbsp;*A. P. Stanley, D.D., in "Sinai and Palestine."*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;3.&nbsp;*"A tree planted by the rivers of water."*&nbsp;—This is an

allusion to the Eastern method of cultivation, by which rivulets of water

are made to flow between the rows of trees, and thus, by artificial means,

the trees receive a constant supply of moisture.

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;3.&nbsp;*"His fruit in his season."*&nbsp;—In such a case expectation is

never disappointed.  Fruit is expected, fruit is borne, and it comes also in

the time in which it should come.  A godly education, under the influences

of the divine Spirit, which can never be withheld where they are earnestly

sought, is sure to produce the fruits of righteousness; and he who reads,

prays, and meditates, will ever&nbsp;*see*&nbsp;the&nbsp;*work*&nbsp;which God has given him to

do; the&nbsp;*power*&nbsp;by which he is to perform it; and the&nbsp;*times, places,*&nbsp;and

&nbsp;*opportunities*&nbsp;for doing those things by which God can obtain most glory,

his own soul most good, and his neighbour most edification.

&nbsp;*Adam Clarke.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;3.&nbsp;*"In his season."*&nbsp;The Lord reckons the times which pass over

us, and puts them to our account: let us, therefore, improve them, and with

the impotent persons at the pool of Bethesda, step in when the angel stirs

the water.  Now the church is afflicted, it is a season of prayer and

learning; now the church is enlarged, it is a season of praise; I am now at

a sermon, I will hear what God will say; now in the company of a learned and

wise man, I will draw some knowledge and counsel from him; I am under a

temptation, now is a fit time to lean on the name of the Lord; I am in a

place of dignity and power, let me consider what it is that God requireth of

me in such a time as this.  And thus as the tree of life bringeth fruit

every month, so a wise Christian, as a wise husbandman, hath his distinct

employments for every month, bringing forth his fruit in his season.

&nbsp;*John Spencer's Things New and Old,*&nbsp;1658.

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;3.&nbsp;*"In  his season."*&nbsp;Oh, golden and admirable word! by which is

asserted the liberty of Christian righteousness.  The ungodly have their

stated days, stated times, certain works, and certain places; to which they

stick so closely, that if their neighbours were perishing with hunger, they

could not be torn from them.  But this blessed man, being free at all times,

in all places, for every work, and to every person, will serve you whenever

an opportunity is offered him; whatsoever comes into his hands to do, he

does it.  He is neither a Jew, nor a Gentile, nor a Greek, nor a barbarian,

nor of any other particular person.  He gives his fruit in his season, so

often as either God or man requires his work.  Therefore his fruits have no

name, and his times have no name.

&nbsp;*Martin Luther.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;3.&nbsp;*"His leaf also shall not wither."*&nbsp;He describes the fruit

before he does the leaf.  The Holy Spirit himself always teaches every

faithful preacher in the church to know that the kingdom of God does not

stand in word but in power.  1 Corinthians 4:20.  Again, "Jesus began both

to do and to teach." Acts 1:1.  And again, "Which was a prophet mighty in

deed and word." Luke 24:19.  And thus, let him who professes the word of

doctrine, first put forth the fruits of life, if he would not have his fruit

to wither, for Christ cursed the fig tree which bore no fruit.  And, as

Gregory saith, that man whose life is despised is condemned by his doctrine,

for he preaches to others, and is himself reprobated.

&nbsp;*Martin Luther.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;3.&nbsp;*"His leaf also shall not wither."*&nbsp;The Lord's trees are all

evergreens.  No winter's cold can destroy their verdure; and yet, unlike

evergreens in our country, they are all fruit bearers.

&nbsp;*C. H. S.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;3.&nbsp;*"And whatsoever he doeth,*&nbsp;[or,&nbsp;*maketh or taketh in*&nbsp;

hand]

&nbsp;*shall prosper."*&nbsp;And with regard to this "prospering," take heed that thou

understandest not a carnal prosperity.  This prosperity is hidden

prosperity, and lies entirely secret in spirit; and therefore if thou hast

not this prosperity that is by faith, thou shouldest rather judge thy

prosperity to be the greatest adversity.  For as the devil bitterly hates

this leaf and the word of God, so does he also those who teach and hear it,

and he persecutes such, aided by all the powers of the world.  Therefore

thou hearest of a miracle the greatest of all miracles, when thou hearest

that all things prosper which a blessed man doeth.

&nbsp;*Martin Luther.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;3.  A critical journal has shown that instead of&nbsp;*"Whatsoever it*&nbsp;

doeth shall prosper,"the rendering might be,&nbsp;*"Whatsoever it produceth*&nbsp;

shall come to maturity."This makes the figure entire, and is sanctioned

by some MSS. and ancient versions.

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;3.  (&nbsp;*last clause*&nbsp;).  Outward prosperity, if it follow close

walking

with God, is very sweet; as the cipher, when it follows a figure, adds to

the number, though it be nothing in itself.

&nbsp;*John Trapp.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;4.&nbsp;*"Chaff."*&nbsp;Here, by the way, we may let the wicked know they

have a thanks to give they little think of; that they may thank the godly

for all the good days they live upon the earth, seeing it is for their sakes

and not for their own that they enjoy them.  For as the chaff while it is

united and keeps close to the wheat, enjoys some privileges for the wheat's

sake, and is laid up carefully in the barn; but as soon as it is divided,

and parted from the wheat, it is cast out and scattered by the wind; so the

wicked, whilst the godly are in company and live amongst them, partake for

their sake of some blessedness promised to the godly; but if the godly

forsake them or be taken from them, then either a deluge of water comes

suddenly upon them, as it did upon the old world when Noah left it; or a

deluge of fire, as it did upon Sodom, when Lot left it, and went out of the

city.

&nbsp;*Sir Richard Baker.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;4.&nbsp;*"Driveth away,"*&nbsp;or tosseth away; the Chaldee translateth for

"wind," "whirlwind."

&nbsp;*Henry Ainsworth,*&nbsp;1639.

This shows the vehement tempest of death, which sweeps away the soul of the ungodly.

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;5.&nbsp;*"Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment,"*&nbsp;etc. And may not a reason also be conceived thus, why the ungodly can never come

to be of the congregation of the righteous: the righteous go a way that God

knows, and the wicked go a way that God destroys; and seeing that these ways

can never meet, how should the men meet that go these ways?  And to make

sure work that they shall never meet indeed, the prophet expresseth the way

of the righteous by the first link of the chain of God's goodness, which is

his&nbsp;*knowledge;*&nbsp;but expresseth the way of the wicked by the last link of

God's justice, which is his&nbsp;*destroying;*&nbsp;and though God's justice and his

mercy do often meet, and are contiguous one to another, yet the first link

of his mercy and the last link of his justice can never meet, for it never

comes to destroying till God be heard to say&nbsp;*Nescio vos, "I know you*&nbsp;

not,"and&nbsp;*nescio vos*&nbsp;in God, and God's knowledge, can certainly never

possibly meet together.

&nbsp;*Sir Richard Baker.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;5.  The Irish air will sooner brook a toad, or a snake, than heaven

a sinner.

&nbsp;*John Trapp.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;6.&nbsp;*"For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of*&nbsp;

the ungodly shall perish."Behold how David here terrifies us away from

all prosperous appearances, and commends to us various temptations and

adversities.  For this "way" of the righteous all men utterly reprobate;

thinking also, that God knoweth nothing about any such way.  But this is the

wisdom of the cross.  Therefore, it is God alone that knoweth the way of the

righteous, so hidden is it to the righteous themselves.  For his right hand

leads them on in a wonderful manner, seeing that it is a way, not of sense,

nor of reason, but of faith only; even of that faith that sees in darkness,

and beholds things that are invisible.

&nbsp;*Martin Luther.*&nbsp;

&nbsp;*Verse*&nbsp;6.&nbsp;*"The righteous."*&nbsp;They that endeavour righteous living in

themselves and have Christ's righteousness imputed to them.

&nbsp;*Thomas Wilcocks,*&nbsp;1586.
